In this task, I performed a sales trend analysis using SQL on a dataset named online_sales, which contains information about customer orders, including order_date, order_id, revenue, and other sales-related metrics. First, I created a database named Sales and executed several queries to analyze the data. I explored how to extract the month and year from the order_date field using built-in SQL functions. The data was grouped by both year and month to analyze trends over time. Key metrics such as total revenue (SUM(revenue)) and order volume (COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) were calculated to understand monthly performance. I also applied a date filter to focus on a specific time period and used ORDER BY to ensure the results were sorted chronologically. This step-by-step process helped me gain insights into seasonal sales patterns and order volume fluctuations using only SQL queries on a single table.
